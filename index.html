        <h1>EEC 172 Final Project</h1>
        <h4>By Khaiber Amin and Nadav Weinberger.</h4>
      
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>For our final embedded systems project, we created a top-down co-op tank shooting game. 
          In the game, two players share control of a tank: one player controls
          the tank's movement to avoid enemy projectiles using the CC3200's built-in accelerometer, 
          while the other player uses a remote control to aim and shoot the tank's cannon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main objective of the game is to defeat as many enemy tanks as possible, 
          while avoiding their projectiles. It is also possible to choose different difficulty settings, 
          which affects the enemies projectile speed.
        </p>
    </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <h3>Functional Specs</h3>
    <p>
      When the program first starts, the title screen is displayed. 
      Once the user presses any remote button, the main menu screen is displayed, 
      where the user can start the game or set the difficulty. When the game is started, 
      a green tank (the player) appears along with a red tank (the enemy) at a random location on screen.
    </p> 
    <p>
      At this point, the enemy begins to fire projectiles at the player. 
      If the player is hit by a projectile, the game ends and returns to the start screen. 
      The speed of the enemy's projectiles is determined by the difficulty setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilting the CC3200 board causes the player tank to move around the screen, 
      and pressing the remote control buttons controls the player's cannon: 
      1 rotates it counterclockwise, 3 rotates it clockwise, and 2 shoots a projectile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an enemy is hit by a projectile, it is removed from the screen, 
      the score increases by one, and a new enemy is spawned at a random location.
    </p>

    <h3>System Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The system consists of the microcontroller, an OLED display connected to it 
      via SPI, and and IR receiver connected through a GPIO pin. The built-in accelerometer 
      communicates with the microcontroller using I2C.
    </p>
    
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The OLED screen was coImplementation of the IR remote and sensor were similar
      to Lab 3. The IR Receiver was connected to our breadboard
      circuit with the VS and GND pins connected to the proper
      lines of the breadboard, and the OUT pin connected to a free
      GPIO pin on the CC3200 board using wires. A 100Ω resistor
      between the VS pins of the IR receiver and micro controller,
      as well as a 100μF capacitor between the VS and GND of the
      IR receiver were used to protect against electrical over stress.
      The circuit schematic can be seen in Figure 3. The OLED screen was connected to our breadboard with 7 wires in total,
      and used SPI to communicate with the CC3200 board. Output
      GPIO pins were used for the DC, OC, and RESET signals of
      the OLED. The MOSI signal of the OLED was connected to
      SPI DOUT (MOSI) on the launchpad, and the SCLK clock
      signal was connected to the SPI CLK signal. Finally, the
      Vin(+) and GND signals of the OLED were connected to the
      3.3V and GND pins of the LaunchPad, respectively. In order to
      make use of the built-in accelerometer of the CC3200 board,
      Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) protocol was used. We made sure
      to include the i2c_if.h file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementing the basic game loop logic involves the use of a
      constantly running while loop, which contained all the logic for
      reading input data from the IR remote to implement player’s aiming
      and firing mechanics, reading the accelerometer data to change the
      player's x and y coordinates, updating the state of the enemy tank,
      and checking if either the player tank or enemy tank have been hit by
      a projectile. Every loop iteraion also updates the screen to show the
      new state of the game to the player. This continuous looping allows
      for the smooth real-time nature of the game
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge we faced was connecting to the
      internet. Initially, we planned to implement a system which
      would upload the high score to the cloud, and retrieve it on
      demand. Unfortunately, We encountered DNS-related issues
      which proved to be impossible to solve during the allotted
      time frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another issue we encountered was our program's size.
      Likely due to the size of the title screen art's bitmap array, the
      code eventually became too large to be loaded to the RAM.
      We were able to solve this problem by modifying the compiler
      settings to optimize the program's size.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, we would finish implementing the AWS high-score
      functionality. A possible upgrade to the high-score feature would be
      a functioning cloud-based leaderboard. This would involve the player
      inputting their name using the IR remote with multi-tap texting (like
      Lab 3) and their scores being sent to AWS servers alongside their
      name. These scores would then be ordered in a leaderboard, showing
      the players with the highest scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, we would like to add movement to the enemy
      tanks, as well as different projectiles types (e.g. exploding, homing
      projectiles).
    </p>
    <p>
      If given additional resources, we could upgrade the hardware used
      in the game by including additional peripherals, such as a joystick
      for player movement, or a larger OLED screen to make the game
      easier to view.
