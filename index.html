        <h1>EEC 172 Final Project</h1>
        <h4>By Khaiber Amin and Nadav Weinberger.</h4>
      
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>For our final embedded systems project, we created a top-down co-op tank shooting game. 
          In the game, two players share control of a tank: one player controls
          the tank's movement to avoid enemy projectiles using the CC3200's built-in accelerometer, 
          while the other player uses a remote control to aim and shoot the tank's cannon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main objective of the game is to defeat as many enemy tanks as possible, 
          while avoiding their projectiles. It is also possible to choose different difficulty settings, 
          which affects the enemies projectile speed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <h3>Functional Specs</h3>
    <p>
      When the program first starts, the title screen is displayed. 
      Once the user presses any remote button, the main menu screen is displayed, 
      where the user can start the game or set the difficulty. When the game is started, 
      a green tank (the player) appears along with a red tank (the enemy) at a random location on screen.
    </p> 
    <p>
      At this point, the enemy begins to fire projectiles at the player. 
      If the player is hit by a projectile, the game ends and returns to the start screen. 
      The speed of the enemy's projectiles is determined by the difficulty setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilting the CC3200 board causes the player tank to move around the screen, 
      and pressing the remote control buttons controls the player's cannon: 
      1 rotates it counterclockwise, 3 rotates it clockwise, and 2 shoots a projectile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an enemy is hit by a projectile, it is removed from the screen, 
      the score increases by one, and a new enemy is spawned at a random location.
    </p>

    <h3>System Architecture</h3>
    <p>
      The system consists of the microcontroller, an OLED display connected to it 
      via SPI, and and IR receiver connected through a GPIO pin. The built-in accelerometer 
      communicates with the microcontroller using I2C.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest challenge we faced was connecting to the
      internet. Initially, we planned to implement a system which
      would upload the high score to the cloud, and retrieve it on
      demand. Unfortunately, We encountered DNS-related issues
      which proved to be impossible to solve during the allotted
      time frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another issue we encountered was our program's size.
      Likely due to the size of the title screen art's bitmap array, the
      code eventually became too large to be loaded to the RAM.
      We were able to solve this problem by modifying the compiler
      settings to optimize the program's size.

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, we would finish implementing the AWS
      high-score functionality. Furthermore, we would like to add
      movement to the enemy tanks, as well as different projectiles
      types (e.g. exploding, homing projectiles).
